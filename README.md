# Scientific-computing
### Programs from Scientific computing course (ECL 201) :-
<ul>
  <li>Sum and average : Write a user defined function to compute the sum and average of two values.</li>
  <li>Arithmetic functions : Familiarize the following arithmetic functions using built in modules :- abs, complex, sine, real, imag, sinc.</li>
  <li>Array addition : Write program to add two random arrays using (a) loop and (b) vectorized computing. Compare time of execution in both the cases.</li>
  <li>Complex array : Write program to read complex 1-D array with at least 5 elements and convert it into an integer array. Then perform any mathematical operation on the first    complex array.</li>
  <li>Realize the functions : Realize the functions sin t, cos t, sinh t and cosh t for the vector t = [0,10] with increment 0.01.</li>
</ul>
