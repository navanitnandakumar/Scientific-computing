# Scientific-computing
### Programs from Scientific computing course (ECL 201) :-
<ul>
  <li>Sum and average : Write a user defined function to compute the sum and average of two values.</li>
  <li>Arithmetic functions : Familiarize the following arithmetic functions using built in modules :- abs, complex, sine, real, imag, sinc.</li>
  <li>Array addition : Write program to add two random arrays using (a) loop and (b) vectorized computing. Compare time of execution in both the cases.</li>
  <li>Complex array : Write program to read complex 1-D array with at least 5 elements and convert it into an integer array. Then perform any mathematical operation on the first    complex array.</li>
  <li>Realize the functions : Realize the functions sin(t), cos(t), sinh(t) and cosh(t) for the vector t = [0,10] with increment 0.01.</li>
  <li>Derivative plot : Compute the first and second derivatives of sin(x) using built in tools such as gradient and plot the derivatives over sin(x) and
    appreciate.</li>
  <li>Integration : Realize the function f(t) = 4t²+3 and plot it for the vector t = [-5,5] with increment 0.01 and use general integration tool to compute integral of f(t) within the limits -2 to +2 and repeat using trapezoidal and simpson method and compare the results.</li>
  <li>First order differential equation : Solve the first order differential equation x' + 2x = 0, with the initial condition x(0) = 1.</li>
  <li>Current transient : Solve for the current transient through an RC network (with RC = 3) that is driven by the signal 5e^(-t).U(t) and plot the solutions.</li>
  <li>Second order differential equation : Solve the second order differential equation x'' + 2x' + 2x = e^(-t). Let x(0)=0 and x'(0)=0.</li>
  <li>Random data plots : Draw stem plots, line plots and bar plots with random data.</li>
  <li>CSV write : Realize the function y = 2 + 5sin(2πft) for f = 1KHz, plot it and write it as a .csv file.</li>
  <li>CSV read : Read the .csv file from CSV write as an array and plot it. Compute the mean and standard deviation of the signal. Plot its histogram with an appropriate bin size.</li>
  <li>Fourier series : Realize the vector t = [0, 100] with an increment of 0.01 and keep T = 20. Realize the following Fourier series : - f(t) = (4/𝜋) * [1-((1/3)cos(2𝜋3t/T))+((1/5)cos(2𝜋5t/T))-((1/7)cos(2𝜋7t/T))+...]
